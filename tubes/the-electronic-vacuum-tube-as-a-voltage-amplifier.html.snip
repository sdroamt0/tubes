electronic vacuum tube as a voltage amplifier</a></h1>
<p>The variation of the voltage applied to the grid of an
electronic vacuum tube, produces a variation of the current from
the anode to the cathode.</p>
<p>The range of variation of current that flows in a vacuum tube is
typically limited from 0 up to a few milliamperes, in vacuum tubes
used as <i>driver tubes</i> (for instance 12AX7 vacuum tubes), or
from 0 up to a few tenths of milliamperes, in vacuum tubes used as
power vacuum tubes (for instance EL34 vacuum tubes).</p>
<p>A load, for instance a resistor, between the anode and the power
supply, as shown in Figure 6, forms a voltage divider, with the
resistance offered by the vacuum tube itself, which depends from
the voltage applied to the grid. This configuration can be used to
obtain a voltage or a power amplifier. When the voltage grid
varies, the vacuum tube changes its internal resistance, and the
voltage measured between the anode and the load, called the
<i>anode voltage</i> or the <i>plate voltage</i>, changes according
to the voltage divider equation:</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="99" height="45" src=
"book_file/image008.png">,</p>
<p>Where <i>V<sub>a</sub></i> is the anode voltage,
<i>R<sub>v</sub></i>, is the resistance offered by the vacuum tube,
regulated by the grid voltage, and <i>R<sub>L</sub></i> is the load
resistance.</p>
<p>It is important to note that <i>the</i> <i>amplified voltage
signal is inverted</i> with respect to the signal voltage applied
to the grid. In fact, when the signal voltage increases, the
current from anode to cathode increases as well, that is the
resistance offered by the vacuum tube decreases, and
correspondingly the voltage seen at the anode decreases as
well.</p>
<p>In case of vacuum tubes used as drivers, as for instance a 12AX7
vacuum tube, given that the current flowing from the anode to the
cathode is very small, we basically exploit only the voltage
amplification, which is typically applied to the grid of the vacuum
tubes of next stage. In output/power vacuum tube, however, given
that more current can flow from the anode to the cathode, the load
can dissipate a significant power. In this case, the load is not
just used to form a voltage divider with the vacuum tube. The load
is the component that actually makes use of the amplified power. In
most cases, it consists of an output transformer or, in case of
output transformer less (OTL) amplifier, a speaker.</p>
<p>Once the power supply and the load are fixed, a variation of the
grid voltage produces a variation of both the anode voltage and the
anode current. These variations, when plotted, form a straight line
called the <i>loadline</i>. This is further discussed in next
section.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref430814307">Figure</a> 6: A vacuum tube can be used
as a voltage amplifier by placing a load between the anode power
supply and the anode itself. The load forms a voltage divider with
the resistance offered by the vacuum tube, which can be controlled
by varying the grid voltage. The voltage signal applied to the grid
is amplified by the voltage signal seen at the anode.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc448603838"></a><a name="_Ref439693496">3.1    The
loadline</a></h2>
<p>A very useful information that is generally provided in the
datasheet of an electronic vacuum tube, is the greph of the average
anode characteristics. Figure 7 shows this graph for a 12AX7 vacuum
tube. In the graph, every black plot corresponds to a certain
voltage applied to the grid. Maintaining the grid voltage fixed,
following the corresponding plot we can see the relatioships
between the anode voltage and the anode current for a specific
vacuum tube. However, if we change the grid voltage, we move from
one plot to the other, in a direction that depends on the load and
on the power supply V+.</p>
<p>Specifically, the anode voltage and the current vary together
along a straight line, whose slope depends on the load and its
intersection, with the anode voltage, depends on the power supply
V+. This line is called the <i>loadline</i> and is very useful for
setting up the operating point, choosing the power supply, and the
load.</p>
<p>Drawing the loadline, in case of a resistive load, is
straightforward. Suppose we apply 300V to the anode and that no
load is applied to the anode, that is <i>R<sub>L</sub></i>=0. Using
the voltage divider equation, that we introduced in previous
section, we can see that we always have
<i>V<sub>a</sub></i>=<i>V+</i>. If we vary the grid voltage from
-4.0 to -1.5, given that the anode voltage is always
<i>V<sub>a</sub></i>=300V, the current varies from 0 up to 3 mA,
following the red stright vertical line, drawn in the figure.</p>
<p>Suppose the load applied between the anode and power supply is
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>=150K ohm. When the the grid voltage is below
-4V, the vacuum tube does not conduce. This means that its internal
resistance is infinite <i>R<sub>v</sub></i>=&#8734;, therefore,
according to the voltage divider equation, the voltage seen at the
anode tends to 300V and no current flows. On the other extreme,
when the vacuum tube is fully conducting, its internal resistance
goes (almost) to <i>R<sub>v</sub></i>=0, and according to the
voltage divider equation, the anode voltage is also 0. In this case
the current flowing is obtained using the Ohm law as
<i>I</i>=<i>V+</i>/<i>R<sub>L</sub></i>=300V/(150k ohm)=2mA. Note
that this in practice never happens. In fact, even when the grid
voltage is 0, the vacuum tube always offer a small internal
resistance which prevents the anode voltage to go to 0. The
loadline, is the straight line that goes through the two points
(minimum and maximum conduction) that we have identified above,
depicted by the green line in the figure.</p>
<p>A load with a small resistance produces a more vertical
loadline, while large values make a more horizontal loadline. Small
values produce more current and less voltage swing, while large
values mainly work on voltage variations.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref434048436">Figure</a> 7: Average anode
characteristic of a 12AX7 triode. Every (black) plot corresponds to
the relationships between anode voltage (x axis) and current from
anode to cathode (y axis), at a fixed grid voltage. If we maintain
the anode voltage fixed and we vary the grid voltage, the current
varies following a vertical line (for example along the red line).
If a load is applied between the anode and the power supply, this
form a voltage divider with the vacuum tube and both voltage and
current vary when the grid voltage varies (for example along the
green line). The line along which the vacuum tube operates depends
on the impedance of the load and is called the loadline.</p>
<h2>3.2    Gain</h2>
<p>Datasheets of electronic vacuum tubes generally specify some
additional parameters that can be used to determine how the signals
applied to the grid are amplified. Two very useful parameters are
the <i>amplification factor</i> <i>m</i> and the <i>anode
resistance</i> (or <i>plate resistance</i>)
<i>r<sub>a</sub></i>.</p>
<p>The amplification factor is defined as the ratio between the
anode voltage variation and the grid voltage variation:</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="61" height="47" src=
"book_file/image011.png">.</p>
<p>The amplification factor represents the maximum voltage
amplification possible for a vacuum tube, which can be ideally be
obtain with a load with infinite resistance. This parameters is
very stable along various operating conditions of the vacuum
tube.</p>
<p>The anode resistance is defined as ratio between the anode
voltage variation and the anode current variation, when the grid
voltage is maintained constant:</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="62" height="45" src=
"book_file/image012.png">, with <i>V<sub>g</sub></i> constant.</p>
<p>The anode resistance is the resistance offered by the vacuum
tube when the grid voltage is maintained constant and we vary the
anode voltage. It can be seen as a series resistance between the
vacuum tube and the anode pin. Its value is not stable and depends
on the anode voltage at which the vacuum tube is operating.
Datasheets, generally report various values of the anode
resistance, associated with the corresponding anode voltage.</p>
<p>Using these parameters, and the value of the resistance
<i>R<sub>L</sub></i> of the load we can obtain the voltage gain of
the voltage amplifier as follows</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="88" height="45" src=
"book_file/image013.png">.</p>
<p>In fact, the load and the anode resistance form a voltage
divider, which reduce the pure gain of the vacuum tube.</p>

Operating point and bias</a></h2>
<p>The operating point was intuitively introduced in Section
2.1.1using the metaphor of the hydraulic valve. We discussed that
the operating point corresponds to the amount of water that flows
when the valve is in idle state, that is when no signal is applied
to the valve and it stands in a fixed position. We discussed that
we generally want that a certain amount of water flows even when no
signal is applied. A signal applied to the valve basically makes
the water flow to vary around the operating point.</p>
<p>Going back to vacuum tubes, once we chose a loadline, the idle
operating point correspond to the position on the loadline, when no
signal is applied to the grid. Suppose a fixed voltage of -1,5
Volts is applied to the grid. In this case, the operating point
highlighted by the red spot in Figure 8. The fixed voltage applied
to the grid is commonly referred as the <i>bias</i> of the vacuum
tube. Suppose we apply an input sinewave signal that ranges between
+1 an -1 volts to the grid. This signal, added to the bias,
produces an oscillation of the voltage applied to the grid in the
range from -0.5 up to -2.5. This, in turns, produces a
corresponding oscillation along the loadline, around the operating
point, as depicted by the red range shown in the figure. If the
operating point is chosen too high, that is if the bias is too
high, as depicted by the blue spot and range, then <i>clipping</i>
occurs when the signal oscillation produce a grid voltage above 0
Volts. In fact, when grid voltage is zero, the vacuum tube has the
maximum conductance, and no additional current is possible even
with higher grid voltages. On the other hand, if the bias is too
low, as depicted by the violet spot and range, then the current
suddenly is cut-off when the signal applied to the grid produce a
too small voltage.</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="434" height="322" id="Immagine 11" src=
"book_file/image014.png"></p>
<p><a name="_Ref434059561">Figure</a> 8: If the operating point is
to high (blue spot and blue range) large signals applied to the
grid produce clipping, since when the grid voltage is 0 we have the
maximum conductance between cathode and anode. On the other hand,
when the operating point is too low (violet spot and violet range),
too small signals bring to zero conductance between cathode and
anode. The operating point also determines the linearity response
of the vacuum tube. If the operating point is correctly chosen (for
instance, red spot and red range), the vacuum tube reacts linearly
to the entire signal range applied to the grid.</p>
<p>The optimal choice of the loadline and of the operating point
should be taken trying to find an operating range where the vacuum
tube operates linearly. The optimal choice should guarantee that
variations of the voltage applied to the grid should be linearly
reflected in variations along the loadline. Graphically, this means
that the operating curves of the vacuum tube corresponding to
different negative voltages applied to the grid should be evenly
distributed along the portion of the loadline used. For instance,
in Figure 8, the intersections between the black plots and the
green loadline are denser in correspondence of value of the grid
voltage around -3.0 Volts. This means that, when the grid voltage
oscillates around -3.0 Volts produce smaller variation of the anode
voltage than when the grid voltage oscillates around -1.0 Volts. If
we apply to the grid a signal that span from -1.0 to -3.0 Volts,
this is not linearly amplified and distortions of the signal are
produced.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc448603840"></a><a name="_Ref443829913">3.4   
Amplifier classes</a></h2>
<p>The operating point also determines the operating class of the
amplifier.</p>
<p>In a <i>Class A</i> amplifier, the bias is set so that the
vacuum tube conducts and amplifies the entire input signal. For
instance, if the operating point is set in correspondence of the
red spot in Figure 8, the obtained amplifier operates in class A,
since it can amplify the entire input signal. Top plot in Figure 9,
depicts a signal amplified by a Class A amplifier.</p>
<p>A <i>Class B</i> amplifier amplifies just half input signal.
Suppose the bias is set so that it is very close to, or on top of,
the intersection of the green loadline and the horizontal axis in
Figure 8. In this case, just the upper part of the signal is
amplified, and the vacuum tube cuts-off in correspondence of the
remaining part of the signal. Centre plot in Figure 9, depicts a
signal amplified by a Class B amplifier. Class B amplifiers are
more efficient since there is no current when there is no input
signal. In a Class A amplifier, significant current traverse the
vacuum tube also in case of quiescence.</p>
<p><i>Class AB</i>amplifiers are a compromise between class A and
Class B. The bias is set so that most of, but not all, the signal
is amplified. Suppose the operating point is set in correspondence
of the violet spot in Figure 8. In this case. The upper part of the
signal is entirely amplified. The lower part of the signal is
amplified until the intersection of the green loadline and the
horizontal axis is reached. At this point the vacuum tube cuts off,
so part of the output signal is missing. Lower plot in Figure 9,
depicts a signal amplified by a Class AB amplifier. Class AB
amplifiers are more efficient than Class A amplifiers and less than
Class B amplifiers.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref443829572">Figure</a> 9: Operating classes. Top
plot depicts Class A operation, where the entire signal is
amplified. Centre plot shows Class B operation. In this case, just
half signal is amplified. Class AB amplifiers, in the lower plot,
amplify most of the signal, and cut-off when the input signal is
below a certain threshold.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc448603841">3.5    Biasing techniques</a></h2>
<p>The grid voltage must be negative with respect to the cathode
voltage. When the amplifier is in a quiescent state, the negative
electric potential difference between the grid and the cathode
determines the quiescent operating point. When a signal, in the
form of a voltage variation, is applied to the grid, this is added
to the bias voltage and it is amplified. There are two widely used
techniques to provide the grid with negative voltage, with respect
to the cathode. The first technique, called <i>fixed</i>
<i>bias</i>, needs a separate voltage supply that offers the wanted
negative voltage. The second technique, called <i>cathode bias</i>,
or <i>self bias</i>, connects the grid to ground and elevates the
cathode voltage so that the grid is negative with respect to it.
There are also variations of these two basic techniques that we
will not discuss here.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603842">3.5.1    Fixed bias</a></h3>
<p>A very simple schema to provide negative voltage to the grid is
given in Figure 10. We use two different voltage supplies. The
voltage supply V<sub>1</sub> is used to give the high tension V+ to
the anode of the vacuum tube. The voltage supply V<sub>2</sub> is
used to generate the gird bias voltage V<sub>g</sub>. The negative
grid bias -V<sub>g</sub> is obtained by connecting the two voltage
supplies in series. The positive of V<sub>2</sub> is connected to
the negative of V<sub>1</sub>. This connection is also connected to
ground. In this way, the positive of V<sub>2</sub> is at ground
level and the negative is at -V<sub>g</sub> with respect to ground
and to the cathode, provided it is also connected to ground. The
grid receives the -V<sub>g</sub> bias voltage using a resistor
<i>R<sub>l</sub></i>. Given that no current goes trough the grid,
in normal operations, the resistor <i>R<sub>l</sub></i> does not
affect the voltage seen at the grid. Its use will be better
discussed in Section 3.1. At this point, we just mention that one
of the purposes of <a><i>R<sub>l</sub></i> (also called the <i>grid
leak</i>) is to provide to the input signal, received by previous
stage, with a high impedance path</a><a class="msocomanchor" id=

obtained by using a separate voltage supply. Voltage supply
V<sub>1</sub> produce the high tension V+ to be given to the vacuum
tube anode. Voltage supply V<sub>2</sub> produces the voltage
V<sub>g</sub> for the grid. The negative voltage -V<sub>g</sub> is
obtained by connecting the positive of V<sub>2</sub> to the
negative of V<sub>1</sub> and both to ground. In this way, the
negative of V<sub>1</sub> and the positive of V<sub>2</sub> are at
ground, the negative of V<sub>2</sub> is at -V<sub>g</sub> and can
be connected to the grid.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603843"></a><a name="_Ref445547858">3.5.2   
Cathode or self bias</a></h3>
<p>Negative voltage between grid and cathode can be obtained by
connecting the grid to ground and by elevating the cathode voltage.
This technique is generally referred as <i>cathode bias</i> or
<i>self bias</i>. A very easy way to elevate cathode voltage is to
connect it to ground through a resistor, as shown in Figure 11. The
resistor <i>R<sub>k</sub></i>, generally called the <i>cathode
resistor</i>, forms a voltage divider with the vacuum tube itself
and the load. Given that current goes trough the vacuum tube, also
in the quiescent state, the voltage at the cathode will be above
ground. Thus, the grid, being connected to ground, will be negative
with respect to the cathode. The value of <i>R<sub>k</sub></i> can
be computed using the ohm law by knowing the bias current, which
should go through the vacuum tube when it is quiescent, and the
negative grid voltage, needed to have this current. Suppose we use
a 12AX7 vacuum tube and that we want a bias current of 0.75 mA.
Using the characteristics curves of this vacuum tube, from Figure
8, we see that, when the high tension V+ is 300 Volts, a grid
voltage of -1.5 Volts, with respect to the cathode, is needed to
obtain 0,75 mA. Using the ohm law we have
<i>R<sub>k</sub></i>=V/I=1.5V/0.75 ma=2k ohm.</p>
<p>It is worth nothing that the cathode resistor introduces a form
of local negative feedback. In fact, when the anode current
increases, the cathode voltage increases as well, since the
resistance offered by the vacuum tube decreases. In this case, the
grid becomes more negative and tends to reduce the vacuum tube
conductions. When anode current decrease, we have the opposite
effect and the grid become less negative, increasing vacuum tube
conduction. In other words, the cathode resistor tends to oppose
the amplification of the signal, by in fact reducing the gain of
the vacuum tube. In order to reduce this effect, a <i>bypass or
decoupling capacitor</i> <i>C<sub>k</sub></i>, is sometimes
introduced in the circuit, as shown in Figure 11. The bypass
capacitor compensates the cathode voltage variation trying to
maintain it as stable as possible. In this way local negative
feedback is significantly reduced and gain significantly increased,
similarly to fixed bias.</p>
<p>Note that the grid is not directly connected to ground. Rather a
resistor leak <i>R<sub>l</sub></i> is used, as we already discussed
for the fixed bias. Given that there is no current in the grid, its
voltage is practically at ground level.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref444453142">Figure</a> 11: The negative voltage of
the grid with respect to the cathode can be obtained by connecting
the grid to ground and by elevating the cathode voltage by means of
a resistance called the cathode resistor. This resistor forms a
voltage divider with the vacuum tube and the load. By carefully
choosing the resistance value, according to the wanted bias current
the cathode voltage can be elevated so that the grid is negative
with respect to it. The cathode resistor can also be bypassed by a
bypass capacitor to reduce the negative feedback introduced by the
cathode resistor and increasing gain.</p>
