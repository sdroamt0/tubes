<p>The output stage has the purpose of amplifying the signal,
possibly produced by a driver stage, so that the necessary power to
drive a speaker is obtained. In the following, we will discuss the
two most used configurations of power amplifiers. First, we will
introduce the <i>Single Ended</i> configuration, where a single
vacuum tube is used to amplify the signal. Then, we will introduce
the <i>Push-Pull</i> configuration, where a pair of vacuum tubes
are used to simultaneously amplify, respectively, a 180 degree
inverted version of the same signal, increasing output power and
reducing distortions.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref439686914">Figure</a> 12: Characteristic curves of
an EL34 power vacuum tube. Red lines shows various options of
loadlines possible with this vacuum tube. In this example possible
values range from 1.1K ohm, to 5.4K ohm.</p>

Single Ended configuration</a></h2>
<p>Figure 12 depicts the characteristic curves of EL34 power vacuum
tubes. Red lines represents various loadlines corresponding to
various loads applied to the anode of the vacuum tube. Each
loadline is also tagged with the corresponding load impedance. The
maximum power that can be dissipated by the anode of an EL34 is
25W, corresponding to the dashed line marked as
"W<sub>a</sub>=25W". All depicted options for the loadlines lay
below this dashed line.</p>
<p>In this example, we can see that load impedance varies from 1.1K
ohm to 5.4K ohm. These values are all far from reasonable values of
impedance of commercial speakers, where typically impedance ranges
from 4 ohm to 16 ohm. Thus, a speaker cannot be directly used as a
load in this case.</p>
<p>An output transformer is generally used to adapt the impedance
required by the output vacuum tubes to the impedance of the
speakers. Output transformers also eliminate the DC applied to the
anode, so that speakers just see the AC corresponding to the
amplified signal.</p>
<p>Figure 13 depicts the basic schema of Single Ended power output
stage using a tetrode (or a pentode, here the suppressor terminal
is not shown) in ultra-linear configuration (see Section 2.2.4) and
an output transformer.</p>
<p>The high voltage V+ is applied to the anode of the power vacuum
tube through the primary of the output transformer. The screen
terminal of the power vacuum tube is connected to a tap from the
primary of the output transformer, corresponding to the wanted
percentage of the anode output signal, to obtain the ultra-linear
configuration.</p>
<p>The resistance <i>R<sub>screen</sub></i>, called <i>screen
stopper</i>, which connects the screen to the transformer tap, is
mainly used to limit the current from the screen, and to avoid
parasitic oscillations of the circuit. Screen current is
particularly dangerous when the power vacuum tube is overdriven,
for instance in case of guitar amplifiers. Typically, values around
1K ohm 2W are used. Smaller values or no resistance at all, is
sometimes used in HiFi amplifiers.</p>
<p>The resistance <i>R<sub>g</sub></i>, called <i>grid stopper</i>,
is used to block high frequency parasitic oscillations and reduce
radio interference. The internal components of a vacuum tube
produce some parasitic capacitance, often referred as the <i>Miller
effect</i>. The grid stopper, together with this capacitance, form
a low pass filter. The value of the grid stopper mainly depends on
the capacitance of the vacuum tube. Values around 4.7K ohm are
generally used for EL34 power vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>The resistance <i>R<sub>l</sub></i>, is the <i>grid leak
resistor</i>. The reference bias voltage goes through this
resistance. It offers a high impedance path to ground to the AC
signal coming from the previous stage. In addition, it also helps
in discharging the positive ions that can accumulate on the grid
due to gas ions forming in the vacuum tubes. This effect is
particularly dangerous since it can cause <i>thermal runaway</i>.
In fact, if positive charges are accumulated on the grid, the grid
become less negative with respect to the cathode and the vacuum
tube conducts more. More current in the vacuum tube produce more
gas ions than accumulate on the grid and more current, until the
vacuum tube is destroyed. The correct value for the grid leak is a
matter of compromise. Large values are preferable to provide
previous stage with a high AC impedance to ground. Small values are
preferable to help the grid to discharge the accumulated positive
gas ions. Datasheets generally provide maximum allowed values for
the grid leak, in terms of maximum impedance from the grid to the
cathode. For instance, Philips EL34 datasheet specifies maximum
0.5M ohm in class B, or 0.7M ohm in class A or AB.</p>
<p>The capacitor <i>C<sub>c</sub></i>, is the <i>coupling
capacitor</i>. It isolates the previous stage from the power stage.
DC is blocked, while AC goes through the capacitor and continues to
ground through the grid leak. No current goes in the vacuum tube,
since it has a very high impedance and the grid sees just voltage
signal. The coupling capacitor and the grid leak form a high pass
filter. The value of the capacitor has to be chosen according to
the desired low <a>frequency cut-off. For instance, if the grid
leak is 200K ohm and we want a frequency cut-off at 7 Hz, we can
use the low pass filter equation to obtain:</a><a class=

<p><a name="_Ref439692574">Figure</a> 13: Basic schema of a Single
Ended power output stage. The load of the vacuum tube consists of a
transformer that accommodates the amplified signal so that it can
be applied to the speaker. The transformer transforms the impedance
of the speaker into an impedance that can be effectively applied to
the anode of the vacuum tube.</p>

Reactive load and loadline computation</a></h3>
<p>In an output transformer, the ratio between the number of turns,
of the primary and the secondary, determines the impedance seen at
the anode, when a load (a speaker in our case) is connected to the
secondary, and an AC signal goes through the primary circuit of the
output transformer.</p>
<p>Let <i>n<sub>p</sub></i> and <i>n<sub>s</sub></i> be
respectively the number of turns of the primary and secondary. Let
<i>V<sub>p</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>s</sub></i> respectively the AC
voltage seen at the primary and the secondary. Finally, let
<i>Z<sub>p</sub></i>, and <i>Z<sub>s</sub></i>, be respectively the
impedance seen at the primary and the impedance of the speaker. We
have the following equations:</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="62" height="49" src=
"book_file/image021.png"> and <img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="81" height="56" src=
"book_file/image022.png">.</p>
<p>In other words, the ratio between the primary and secondary
voltages is equal to the ratio between the primary and secondary
turns. The ratio between the primary and secondary impedances is
equal to the square of the ratio between the primary and secondary
turns.</p>
<p>It is worth nothing that, according to the second equation, we
can change the impedance, seen by the anode of the vacuum tube, by
changing the impedance of the speaker. The impedance of the speaker
is reflected to the primary of the transformer, according to the
number of turns of the primary and secondary of the transformer.
Suppose that we use a speaker with an impedance of 8 ohms and we
want to have a load of 3.8K ohms to be seen by the anode. Then, the
square of the ratio between the primary and secondary turns should
be 3.8k/8=475. If we connect a speaker of 4 ohm to the secondary of
the same transformer, then the impedance seen by the anode will be
475*4 ohm=1.9K ohm. If we connect a speaker of 16 ohm, we will have
475*16 ohm=7600 ohm.</p>
<p>A transformer is a reactive load that offers an impedance just
when an AC signal goes through its primary. There is no impedance
when just DC is applied to the primary. When no AC signal is
applied to the grid, the vacuum tube is in a quiescent state and no
AC signal is produced at the anode. In this case, only the DC
current, regulated by to the grid bias (see Section 2.5), goes
through the primary and no impedance is seen by the anode. In this
case, also no signal is transferred from the primary to the
secondary of the transformer.</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="505" height="291" id="Immagine 5" src=

<p><a name="_Ref443066632">Figure</a> 14: In case of a resistive
load, with an anode voltage of 400V, the loadline would be along
the green line, and the operating point with a bias current of 40mA
would be at the green spot. However, an output transformer has a
reactive behaviour. In this case, there is a resistance just when
an AC signal goes through it. There is no resistance when the
vacuum tube is quiescent, so the quiescent voltage remains 400V
independently of the bias current. In case of a bias current of
40mA the operating point is depicted by the red spot. When the
vacuum tube amplifies an AC signal, an AC current goes from anode
to cathode and trough the transformer, which now offers a
resistance. The loadline, in this case, as depicted by the red
line, is parallel to the resistive loadline, and shifted so that it
passes through the operating point. Note that the voltage reached
by the anode, in case of a reactive load, might be higher than the
voltage V+ applied to the transformer primary. This is due to the
transformer reacting to current variations, virtually accumulating
and releasing energy accordingly.</p>
<p>If we had a resistive load, we could have computed the loadline
as we described in Section 3.1. For instance, suppose we have a
load of 3.8k ohm and a voltage V+ of 400V. When there is no current
from anode to cathode the anode voltage is 400V. When the vacuum
tube does not offer resistance, the anode voltage is 0 and the
current is 400V/3.8k ohm=105mA. We can draw the resistive loadline,
which correspond to the green line in Figure 14. Suppose we apply a
bias current of 40mA, then the quiescent operating point
corresponds to the green spot in the figure.</p>
<p>However, in our case the load is an output transformer, which
has a reactive load. The transformer offers resistance just to AC
signals that go through it. There is almost no resistance to DC.
More specifically, when the vacuum tube is in a quiescent state,
just DC goes from the anode to the cathode, corresponding to the
bias current. In this case, the transformer does not offer any
resistance. This means that the voltage applied to the cathode is
the same than the V+ voltage applied to the transformer primary,
400V in our example. Therefore, if the bias current is 40mA, the
operating point is depicted by the red spot in Figure 14. When an
AC signal goes through the vacuum tube, the transformer offers its
3.8k ohm of impedance, so the anode voltage and current start
oscillating along the reactive loadline represented by the red line
in the figure. Note that reactive loadline is parallel to the
resistive loadline, and shifted higher so that it goes through the
reactive operating point. It might seem strange that the anode
voltage can now reach values higher than the 400V applied to the
transformer primary. However, this is normal and is due to the fact
that the transformer reacts to current variations, virtually
accumulating and releasing energy in accordance to these
variations.</p>
<p>When you chose an output transformer for you vacuum tube
amplifier, once you have chosen your loadline, you should check
both the transformer primary and secondary impedances, stated by
the transformer manufacturer. It is also worth mentioning that
speakers, generally do not have a constant impedance. Rather, the
speaker's impedance varies with the frequency of the sound being
reproduced. Figure 15 shows the real impedance of speakers rated
for 11 ohm. The real impedance is very high around 100 Hz. It goes
to 6 ohm at 400 Hz, then jumps to 11 ohm at 3k Hz, and then back at
4 ohm to 20k Hz. This means that the slope of the loadline might
vary significantly depending on the reproduced frequencies. The
loadline, that is typically plotted as thin line, is in fact a
blurred area around the thin loadline.</p>

impedance varies with the frequency of the sound being reproduced.
The graph above refers to real speakers rated for 11 ohm. However,
real impedance varies from 4 ohms at frequencies around 20k Hz, to
11 ohm around 3k Hz. There is also s mall difference between right
and left speaker.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc448603847">4.2    Push-Pull configuration</a></h2>
<p>In a push-pull amplifier, two vacuum tubes are used each to
amplify phase-inverted copies of the same signal. The amplified
signals are also phase inverted as well and are combined together
using an output transformer appositively conceived for push-pull
configuration. The push-pull output transformer has a centre tap
were the high voltage V+ is applied. The two ends of the output
transformer are symmetrically connected to the two anodes of the
vacuum tubes. A phase splitter is used, before the stage, to create
two phase-inverted copies of the same input signal.</p>
<p>The basic schema of a push-pull amplifier stage is depicted in
Figure 16. It is composed of two vacuum tubes having an identical
configuration and circuitry. The centre tap of the primary of the
push-pull output transformer receives the V+ voltage. Anodes of the
two vacuum tubes are connected to the two ends of the output
transformer primary. Similarly, the two taps for ultra-linear
configuration are connected to the two screens of the vacuum
tube<a>s. If we consider just half transformer and one vacuum tube,
the schema is practically identical to the single ended
configuration</a><a class="msocomanchor" id="_anchor_3"
onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_3','_com_3')" onmouseout=
"msoCommentHide('_com_3')" href="#_msocom_3" language="JavaScript"
name="_msoanchor_3">[GA3]</a> . A push-pull can be seen as two
single ended stages connected together through the push-pull output
transformer. When no signal is applied to phase splitter, no signal
I received by the two power vacuum tubes and just the bias current
flows from anode to cathode. The current enters from the
transformer primary centre tap and flows in opposite direction
through the transformer toward the first and the second vacuum
tube. Since the current flows in opposite directions, in the two
half of the transformer, one current cancel the electro-magnetic
effect of the other. Therefore, push-pull transformers core can be
made smaller than single ended ones and without air gaps. In order
to have signals with inverted phases at the grid of the two vacuum
tubes, a phase splitter is used that take the input signal and give
the two signals to the push-pull stage. Phase splitters will be
discussed later in Section 4:. The two amplified signals are
identical, even if they have inverted phases, and make the current
to vary symmetrically, with respect to the bias current, in the two
half of the push-pull transformer. When in one half of the
transformer current increases, with respect to the bias current, in
the other half current decreases of the same amount. The same
effect happens to the voltage seen by the two anodes of the two
vacuum tubes. On the load line, this effect is seen as the
operating point of the vacuum tubes moving in opposite directions,
as depicted in Figure 17, where the operating points of the two
vacuum tubes are represented respectively by the .green and yellow
arrow.</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="412" height="290" id="Immagine 22" src=

<p><a name="_Ref443497082">Figure</a> 16: Example of a push-pull
configuration. The phase splitter, which will be discussed later,
takes the input signal and returns two copies of the same signal
with each with phase inverted with respect to the other. The two
signals are given to two vacuum tubes that amplify them separately.
The primary of the output transformer used for a push-pull stage
has a centre tap that takes the high voltage. The two ends of the
primary go to the anodes of the two vacuum tubes. Given that the
two vacuum tubes amplify signals that are 180&#176; one from the
other, in the two ends current varies with opposite amounts. That
is, when in one end current increases, in the other end current
decreases of the same amount.</p>
<p>The power vacuum tubes used in a power stage should be perfectly
matched to guarantee a symmetrical behaviour. In order to fine tune
the two power vacuum tubes, the two bias voltages V<sub>1</sub>-
and V<sub>2</sub>- should be adjustable so that the quiescent bias
current is exactly the same in the two vacuum tubes.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref444356433">Figure</a> 17: The two power vacuum
tubes are at the same operating point, depicted by the red spot,
when quiescent. When a signal is amplified, since the vacuum tubes
receive signals with inverted phases, they move in different
directions. When one conducts more, as depicted by the green arrow,
the other conduct less, as shown by the yellow arrow.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603848"></a><a name="_Ref444355662">4.2.1   
Push-pull advantages</a></h3>
<p>Push pull amplifiers offers some advantages with respect to
single ended. We already mentioned that output transformers can be
made smaller than those needed for single ended amplifiers. Two
additional advantages are the reduction of the harmonic
distortions, and the increased output power.</p>
<p>When the vacuum tube's operating range is in an asymmetrically
nonlinear area, that is when it is more dense on one side of the
loadline (the grid voltage lines will intersect more densely the
loadline), and less dense in the other side (the grid voltage lines
will intersect less densely the loadline), second order harmonics
are generated. For instance, in Figure 14, grid voltage lines
intersect the red loadline more densely with an anode voltage
higher than 400 volts, than with an anode voltage lower than 200
volts. Therefore, half signal is amplified very differently than
the other half signal. Remember that the signal corresponds to
different grid voltages, so to different points along the loadline
identified by the intersection of the grid voltage lines with the
loadline. Figure 18 shows this effect. In the upper plot the anode
current of two vacuum tubes in push-pull are shown. Since each
vacuum tube amplifies a phase inverted signal, with respect to the
other, the currents at the anodes of the two vacuum tubes are phase
inverted as well. Note that the current signal is somehow flattened
in the lower parts of the plot. This is because on the right side
of the loadline of Figure 14 there is less current variation, in
correspondence of the same grid voltage variation, with respect to
the left side of the loadline. This asymmetric behaviour introduces
even order (mainly second order) harmonic distortions. However,
given that these signals are phase inverted, signal flattening
occurs in one vacuum tube at time. When one vacuum tube is
operating in a more dense area, the other is operating in a less
dense area. When one vacuum tube flattens the signal, the other
vacuum tube does not. The two phase inverted signals are combined
in the output transformer and even order harmonics, generated by
the power vacuum tubes, are significantly attenuated, or cancelled
at the output transformer, as can be seen in the lower plot of the
figure. Note, however, that harmonic distortions introduced by
previous stages or third order harmonics, introduced by symmetric
nonlinearity, are amplified and not attenuated. Harmonic
distortions produced by stages preceding the push-pull stage can be
attenuated using global negative feedback, as discussed later in
Section 5.2.</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="643" height="362" id="Immagine 14" src=
"book_file/image027.png"></p>
<p><a name="_Ref443824813">Figure</a> 18: The upper plot shows the
anode current of two vacuum tubes configured as push-pull when they
amplify a signal. Note that when the amplified signal produced by
one vacuum tube flattens in the lower part, due to the introduction
of even order harmonics, the other vacuum tube compensates. The
result is that the signal coming out from the output transformer,
shown in the lower plot, is again an almost perfect sinusoidal
signal.</p>
<p>The push-pull configuration also offers the possibility of
increasing the headroom, which is the operating range along the
loadline. Larger headroom implies higher output power. When the
amplitude of the input signal is too large, either the vacuum tube
clips or it cuts-off (see Section 2.5). In a Single ended
configuration, this is something that is avoided by setting the
bias so that it works in Class A condition (see Section 2.6) and
taking care that the input signal is not too large, limiting
therefore the amplifier headroom. However, in a push-pull amplifier
we can set the bias so that vacuum tubes operate in class AB,
without problems. In class AB, one vacuum tube amplify most of the
signal and cuts-off when the input signal is below a certain
threshold. Cut-off happens when the signal reaches the point where
the loadline intersects the horizontal axis. When operating in
class AB, given that the two vacuum tubes amplify phase inverted
signals, if one vacuum tube cuts-off, the other vacuum tube still
amplify the inverted signal. This is depicted in the upper plot of
Figure 19. The output transformer combine the two signals and an
almost perfect signal is sent to the speaker, as shown in the lower
plot of Figure 19. Operating in class AB allow setting the bias so
that the vacuum tubes can cut-off in correspondence of large
signals, increasing the exploited headroom.</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="643" height="362" id="Immagine 15" src=
"book_file/image028.png"></p>
<p><a name="_Ref443827710">Figure</a> 19: When operating in class
AB, one vacuum tube amplifies just part of the whole signal, as
shown in the upper plot. However, when one vacuum tube cuts-off the
other still amplifies the signal, and vice versa. When the two
signals are combined, in the output transformer, the original input
signal is restored as shown in the lower plot.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603849"></a><a name="_Ref443758743">4.2.2   
Loadline selection</a> and operating point</h3>
<p>In a push pull output transformer, the impedance rating is
referred to the whole impedance seen from one end to the other end
of the primary. However, the transformer is simultaneously used by
two vacuum tubes that see half the impedance rating of the
transformer. Therefore, when using a push pull transformer with an
impedance of 7.6K ohm, each anode sees an impedance of 3.8K ohm.
When drawing the loadline for the power vacuum tubes of a push-pull
amplifiers, half the transformer impedance is the value that must
be used as a reference.</p>
<p>The method for drawing the loadline, along with the relationship
between the actual transformer impedance and the speaker impedance,
has already been discussed in Section 3.1.1. However, at a closer
look, in case of a push-pull power stage, we have an additional
consideration to make. We just said that the impedance seen by each
anode is half that of the end-to-end impedance of the transformer
primary. This is true only when both vacuum tubes are operating
simultaneously, for instance, when both vacuum tubes operate in
class A. In a push-pull power stage, class AB operation is
generally used. In a class AB amplifier, as discussed in Sections
2.6 and 3.2.1, one vacuum tube might stop conducting while the
other is fully active, and vice versa. When one of the two vacuum
tubes does not conduce, just half transformer is used. In this
case, the impedance seen by the anode is not half than that of the
entire transformer. In fact, we already said that the impedance of
the transformer goes with the square of the ratio between the
number of turns, of the primary and the secondary of the
transformer. If we use half transformer, we use half turns of the
transformer primary and the impedance seen at the anode is one
fourth of the entire transformer impedance. This can be verified
using the equations discussed in Section 3.1.1.</p>
<p>Figure 20 clarifies these aspects. When the two vacuum tubes
amplify each, a signal inverted with respect to the other, their
operating points moves in opposite directions along the loadline,
starting from the quiescent operating point. The green and the
yellow arrow represent the simultaneous position of the two vacuum
tubes along the loadline. Suppose the signal amplified by the
yellow vacuum tube, is such that it reaches the bottom of the graph
and quits conducting. The green vacuum tube, at this point, sees a
different impedance at its anode and the loadline slope changes
accordingly. From this point on, the green arrow follows the solid
red line, rather than the dashed line, corresponding to the
continuation of the previous loadline. When the signal being
amplified is such that the yellow vacuum tube starts conducting
again, the green arrow will be back at the position where the
impedance first changed, to see the original impedance again, and
to continue along the solid red line. Note, of course, that the
impedance change is not abrupt as depicted in the picture. The
impedance change smoothly, while the yellow vacuum tube is in the
process of quitting conduction.</p>
