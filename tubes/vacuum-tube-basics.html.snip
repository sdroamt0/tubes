<h2>Vacuum tube basics</h2>
<p>
Before we actually enter into to the details of designing a tube amplifier, we have to discuss some <a href="#" onclick="my_modal_open('introduction.html.snip')">basics</a> principles related to electronic vacuum tubes. If you already know how vacuum tubes operate, you can skip this chapter and move directly to the next one.
</p>
<h3>Hydraulic valves</h3>
<p>
The operating modality of a vacuum tube can be explained assimilating it to a hydraulic valve. Suppose a bucket, filled with water, is connected to a pipe, having a hydraulic valve to control the flow of water through it. Refer to Figure 1, to follow the example. If the position of the bucket is higher than the other end of the pipe, the potential energy of the water contained in the bucket is higher than that of the end of the pipe. This implies that the water naturally flows from the bucket at the top toward the bottom end of the pipe.
</p>
<p>
However, if the valve is closed, as in Figure 1 a), the water flow is stopped. When the valve is fully open, as in Figure 1 b), the water flows freely. If the position of the valve is dynamically controlled with a signal, as sketched in Figure 1 c), the flow of water in the pipe follows the signal applied to the valve.
</p>
<h4>Operating point</h4>
<p>
Suppose now we want to apply a signal to the valve position so that the variation of the flow at the end of the pipe follows precisely the position of the valve. In order to obtain that, we have to choose an operating point for the valve. The operating point, in a few words, refers to the position of the valve when no signal is applied to it. Alternatively, we can consider the operating point as the amount of water that flows when no signal is applied to the valve. We can assume that the signal oscillates with positive and negative values around an idle point. Suppose the operating point is set so that the valve is fully closed when there is no signal. In this case, the flow cannot follow the negative part of the signal, when the signal goes below the idle point, since the valve is already fully close and no further reduction of the flow is possible. Similarly, if the valve is fully open at the idle point, it is not possible to follow the positive part of the signal, when the signal is above the idle point, since no further increase of the flow is possible. In general, when the operating point is too high, as shown in Figure 2 a) we might lose the highest parts of the signal. When the operating point is too low, as shown in Figure 2 b) we might lose the lowest parts of the signal. In Figure 2 c) the entire dynamic range of the signal is correctly followed.

<h3>Electronic vacuum tubes</h3>
<p>
The operating principle of a vacuum tube is basically similar to that of an hydraulic valve. In place of water flowing in pipes you have electrons travelling along copper wires or vacuum space. In place of potential energy given to the water by the effect of the gravity, you have electrical potential (or voltage) that force electrons to move through copper wires and vacuum space. Finally, an electronic valve can control the flow of electrons, analogously to what we described for hydraulic valves.
In the following sections, we will introduce the basic types of electronic vacuum tubes and their operating principles.
