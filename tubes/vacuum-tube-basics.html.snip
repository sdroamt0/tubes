<h1><a name="_Toc448603828">2:     Vacuum tube basics</a></h1>
<p>Readers that already know, what vacuum tubes are and how they
operate, can skip this chapter and move directly to the next one.
For the non-initiated, before entering into to the details of
designing a vacuum tube amplifier, we have to discuss some basics
principles related to electronic vacuum tubes.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc448603829"></a><a name="_Ref429930633">2.1   
Hydraulic valves</a></h2>
<p>The operating modality of an electronic vacuum tube can be
explained assimilating it to a <i>hydraulic valve</i>. Suppose a
bucket, filled with water, is connected to a pipe that has a
hydraulic valve to control the flow of water through it. Refer to
Figure 1, to follow the example. If the position of the bucket is
higher than the other end of the pipe, the potential energy of the
water contained in the bucket is higher than that of the end of the
pipe. This implies that the water naturally flows from the bucket
toward the bottom end of the pipe, and we have <i>current</i> of
water.</p>
<p>However, if the valve is closed, as in Figure 1 a), the water
flow stops. When the valve is fully open, as in Figure 1 b), the
water flows freely. If the position of the valve is dynamically
controlled with a signal, as sketched in Figure 1 c), the intensity
water flow, through the pipe, follows the signal-controlled
position of the valve.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref429916591">Figure</a> 1: A vacuum tube can be
assimilated to a hydraulic valve. When the valve is closed (a), no
water flows through the pipe. When the valve is open (b) water
flows. When position of the valve is dynamically controlled with a
signal, the water flow follows the signal.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603830"></a><a name="_Ref434057697">2.1.1   
Operating point</a></h3>
<p>Suppose we want to apply a signal to the valve position (the
<i>input signal</i>) so that the variation of the flow at the end
of the pipe (<i>output or amplified signal</i>) follows precisely
the position of the valve. In order not to lose portions of the
input signal, we have to choose an operating point for the valve.
The <i>operating point</i>, in a few words, refers to the position
of the valve when no signal is applied to it. Alternatively, we can
consider the operating point as the amount of water that flows when
no signal is applied to the valve. We can assume that the input
signal oscillates producing positive and negative values. The input
signal has the effect of shifting the valve in a more open or less
open position, with respect to the operating point.</p>
<p>Suppose the operating point is set so that the valve is fully
closed, when there is no signal. In this case, the flow cannot
follow the negative part of the signal. In fact, when the signal
goes below the quiescent point, since the valve is already fully
close, no further reduction of the flow is possible. Similarly, if
the valve is fully open at the quiescent point, it is not possible
to follow the positive part of the signal. When the signal is above
the quiescent point no further increase of the flow is possible,
since the valve is already fully open.</p>
<p>In general, when the operating point is too high, as shown in
Figure 2 a) we might lose the highest parts of the signal. When the
operating point is too low, as shown in Figure 2 b) we might lose
the lowest parts of the signal. In Figure 2 c) the entire dynamic
range of the signal is correctly amplified.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref429921236">Figure</a> 2: Choosing the operating
point of the valve. If the operating point is too high (a), signals
that need to turn the valve in a position higher than the fully
open positions, are lost. If the operating point is too low (b),
signals that need to turn the valve in a position that is lower
than the fully close position, are lost. If the operating point is
correctly tuned, the full dynamic range of the signal can be
correctly amplified.</p>
<p>We will see that the choice of the operating point of an
electronic vacuum tube determines the operating class of the
amplifier (Class A, Class AB, or Class B). The operating point also
affects power consumption, and response linearity of the amplifier
itself.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc448603831">2.2    Electronic vacuum tubes</a></h2>
<p>The operating principle of an <i>electronic vacuum</i>
<i>tube</i> is basically similar to that of an hydraulic valve. In
place of water flowing in pipes there are electrons travelling
along copper wires or vacuum space. In place of potential energy,
due to the effect of the gravity on the water, there is electrical
potential (or voltage), which forces electrons to move through
copper wires and vacuum space. Finally, an electronic valve can
control the flow of electrons, analogously to what was described
above for hydraulic valves.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will introduce the basic types of
electronic vacuum tubes and their operating principles.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603832">2.2.1    Diode</a></h3>
<p>The simplest type of electronic vacuum tube is the <i>diode</i>,
depicted on the left of Figure 3. A diode has two terminals: a
<i>cathode</i> and an <i>anode</i>. When the cathode is heated
enough, electrons start to leave its surface, due to the thermionic
effect. Since electrons have a negative charge, when a positive
electrical potential (V+), higher than that of the cathode, is
applied to the anode, the electrons emitted by the cathode move
toward the anode itself.</p>
<p>By convention, the direction of an electric current is that of
the "positive" charges movement. In electric circuits, there is a
current of electrons, having a negative charge, from the lower
potential to the higher potential, which is equivalent to having a
positive charge current in the opposite direction. Due to this
convention, the direction of the electric current is said to go
from the higher potential to the lower potential. In our case, we
say that the electric current goes from the anode to the cathode,
even if the electrons actually move in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603833"></a><a name="_Ref430809739">2.2.2   
Triode</a></h3>
<p>What we have just described above is very similar to the example
we made in Section 4 where the water flows from the bucket through
the pipe under the effect of the gravity. Here the current flows
from the high potential V+ applied to the anode toward the ground
potential of the cathode. However, we still need a valve that
allows us to control this flows.</p>
<p>As depicted on the right of Figure 3, in a <i>triode</i>, a
third terminal, called <i>grid</i>, is placed between the anode and
the cathode. If the electrical potential of the grid is negative
(lower) enough, with respect to the cathode, the electrons emitted
by the cathode are repelled and pushed back, so they cannot reach
the anode. In this way, the current is blocked, obtaining the same
effect of closing the valve in the hydraulic circuit. On the other
hand, if the grid potential is the same than that of the cathode,
the current flows freely from the anode to the cathode, obtaining
the same effect of opening the valve in the hydraulic circuit. With
a triode, it is possible to control the amount of electrons
reaching the anode, varying the electrical potential of its grid.
When a voltage signal is applied to the grid, the electric current,
from the anode to the cathode, follows the same signal.</p>
<p>Note that the grid potential can also be positive with respect
to the cathode. In this case, also the grid starts attracting the
electrons emitted by the cathode, and a current flows from the grid
to the cathode as well. This situation is very dangerous, since the
vacuum tube can be damaged. However, this effect is sometime
exploited in guitar amplifiers in order to explicitly produce
distort sound. In this book, we will not take into consideration
this possibility, since we are introducing high fidelity audio
amplifiers, where distortion must be avoided.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref429930179">Figure</a> 3: Diode, on the left. Triode
on the right. When the cathode of a vacuum tube is heated,
electrons are emitted. If the anode ha an electrical potential
higher than the cathode, the emitted electrons are attracted by it
and an electric current start to flow (by convention the current
goes from the positive to the negative end, even if actually the
electrons, which have a negative charge, move from the negative to
the positive end). In a triode, if the electrical potential of the
grid, lying between the cathode and the anode, is negative enough
with respect to the cathode, the electrons, emitted by the cathode,
are repelled and do not reach the anode.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603834">2.2.3    Tetrode</a></h3>
<p>The basic idea of the triode was refined with the introduction
of the <i>tetrode</i>. A tetrode, as shown in Figure 4 on the left,
has a fourth electrode called <i>screen</i>, between the anode and
the grid. The screen has the purpose of reducing the capacitance
formed by the grid and the anode. In fact, in a triode, the grid
and the anode are very close one to the other and behave as a small
capacitor. If the voltage of the screen is maintained higher than
that of the cathode and the grid, but lower than the anode, during
the operation of the vacuum tube, it acts as an electrostatic
screen between the grid and the anode, thus reducing their inherent
capacitance.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603835"></a><a name="_Ref439693074">2.2.4   
Tetrode in ultra-linear configuration</a></h3>
<p>In a tetrode, the screen is positive with respect to the
cathode. Thus, it attracts a certain amount of the electrons
emitted from the cathode itself, which would have gone to the
anode. The result is a small current flowing through the screen.
This effect is exploited to configure a vacuum tube to work in
<i>distributed load</i>, or <i>ultra-linear</i> modality. This
configuration is obtained by feeding back a percentage of the anode
output signal to the screen, rather than applying a fixed voltage
to it. The wanted percentage of anode output signal is typically
provided to the screen by connecting it to a tap, coming out from
the output transformer, as shown on the right side of Figure 4. The
current through the screen, produces a sort of negative feedback
and, with the appropriate percentage of anode signal, distortion
falls at very small values, just slightly reducing power
efficiency. The optimal percentage to be applied to the screen
depends on the specific electronic vacuum tubes used. In many power
amplifier designs, this percentage is generally set around 43%.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref430121709">Figure</a> 4: In a tetrode, on the left,
a fourth electrode is used as a screen to limit the inherent
capacitance between grid and anode. The screen can also be set to
operate in ultra-linear configuration, on the right, by providing
it with a percentage of the anode output signal.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc448603836">2.2.5    Pentode</a></h3>
<p>Tetrodes were further refined with the introduction of the
<i>pentode</i>. When electrons emitted by the cathode reach the
anode, they might have enough energy to stimulate secondary
electron emission from the anode itself. Secondary emission
electrons might reach the screen grid, causing instability and
oscillations. In order to prevent secondary emission electrons from
reaching the screen grid, a fifth electrode, called
<i>suppressor</i> is added in a <i>pentode</i>, as shown in Figure
5. The suppressor is generally directly connected to the cathode,
either with an internal connection in the vacuum tube, or by an
explicit connection between the pins, corresponding to the
suppressor and the cathode, as depicted by the dashed line in
Figure 5.</p>
