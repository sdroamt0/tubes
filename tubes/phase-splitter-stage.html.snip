Concertina</a></h2>
<p>The basic schema of a <i>concertina</i>, or <i>cathodyne</i>,
phase splitter is given in Figure 21. Two resistors of exactly the
same resistance R<sub>k</sub>=R<sub>a</sub> are connected
respectively from the high tension source V+ and the anode, and
from the cathode to the ground. In this way, the two resistors,
along with the vacuum tube internal resistance, form a voltage
divider. When grid voltage increases, the vacuum tube resistance
decreases. When the vacuum tube resistance decreases the voltage at
the anode decrease, and the voltage at the cathode increases of
exactly the same amount. Similarly, when the grid voltage decrease,
we see the anode voltage increasing and the cathode voltage
decreasing of exactly the same amount. If the two resistors are
perfectly matched, two phase inverted signals of exactly the same
amplitude can be taken at the anode and at the cathode of the
vacuum tube. These two signals can be fed to the push-pull vacuum
tubes of the next stage.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref445540967">Figure</a> 21: The concertina phase
splitter uses two resistors of the same resistance
R<sub>ck</sub>=R<sub>a</sub> connected to the anode and to the
cathode of a vacuum tube. Voltage variations of at the anode and at
the cathode of the vacuum tube, due to a signal applied to the
grid, are of the same amplitude and with inverted phases. A voltage
divider, built with appropriate values of R<sub>1</sub> and
R<sub>2</sub>, is used to provide the gird with the correct bias
voltage. The coupling capacitor C<sub>c</sub> is used to isolate
the previous stage from the bias voltage applied to the grid.</p>
<p>Bias voltage to the vacuum tube grid is obtained using a voltage
divider composed of the resistors R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>.
The voltage applied to the grid should be, as usual, negative with
respect to the cathode voltage. In this configuration, the cathode
voltage is higher than ground due to the effect of the cathode
resistor R<sub>k</sub>. Let I<sub>b</sub>, be the bias current. The
quiescent cathode voltage is
V<sub>c</sub>=R<sub>k</sub>&#215;I<sub>b</sub>. For instance,
suppose we want a bias current I<sub>b</sub> of 1 mA and that the
cathode resistance R<sub>k</sub> is 100k ohm. The cathode voltage
is V<sub>k</sub>=100k ohm &#215; 1 ma= 100 Volts.</p>
<p>Suppose we want the operating point to be in correspondence of
the red spot in Figure 22. The bias voltage applied to the grid
should be approximatively 1.25 Volts below the cathode voltage,
that is 98.75 Volts from ground. To compute the correct values for
R1 and R2 we can use the voltage divider equations:</p>
<p class="c1"><img class="w3-border w3-padding-tiny w3-padding-hor-4 w3-round" width="200" height="45" src=
"book_file/image031.png"></p>
<p>Suppose high tension V+ is 380 Volts, the ratio between the two
resistors must be (380/98,75)-1&#8776; 2,85. For example,
R<sub>1</sub>=1,2M ohm and R<sub>2</sub>=560k ohm are realistic
values that give a ration very close to the needed one.</p>
<p>The grid stopper resistor <i>R<sub>g</sub></i> has the purpose
of blocking very high frequencies and parasitic oscillations, by
creating a low pass filter together with the internal vacuum tube
capacitance, as already discussed in Section 3.1. The grid stopper
resistor must be soldered directly on the pin of the vacuum tube
socket. Values around 47k ohm are generally used for vacuum tubes
like the 12AX7. The coupling capacitor <i>C<sub>c</sub></i>,
isolates previous stage from the bias voltage given to the grid
<a>The coupling capacitor and <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> form a high pass
filter. <i>C<sub>c</sub></i> has to be chosen according to the low
frequency cut-off. For instance. If R<sub>2</sub> is 560K ohm and
we want a frequency cut-off at 7 Hz, we have:</a></p>

<p>The cathode resistor <i>R<sub>k</sub></i> puts the vacuum tube
under heavy local negative feedback. As explained in Section 2.7.2
the cathode resistor tend to vary the cathode voltage in the same
direction than the grid voltage variation, thus opposing the grid
to cathode voltage variation. The cathode resistor value, generally
used in a concertina phase splitter, offers a heavy negative
feedback, which significantly reduces the gain of the vacuum tube.
For instance, in a concertina, built using a 12AX7 vacuum tube, the
gain is around 0.99, at each output. In practice, in this case, we
can imagine that the concertina simply takes the input signal and
produces two outputs signals (one inverted with respect to the
other) practically of the same amplitude of the input signal.</p>
<p>The values of the anode and cathode resistors determine the load
seen by the vacuum tube, and consequently the loadline. The total
load seen by the vacuum tube is the
<i>R<sub>a</sub></i>+<i>R<sub>k</sub></i>. However, when a signal
is applied to the grid, the two output signals also traverse the
coupling capacitors <i>C<sub>cp</sub></i>, between the concertina
and the power stage, and go to the two grid leak resistors
<i>R<sub>l</sub></i>. The two grid leak resistors are respectively
in parallel to the anode and cathode resistors of the concertina.
The total load, in this case, is the sum of the resistances
resulting from the parallel effect of cathode resistor and one grid
leak, on one side, and the anode resistor and the other grid leak,
on the other side. In a few words, we have two different loadlines.
One loadline, which we call the <i>static loadline</i>, has to be
considered when the vacuum tube is in a quiescent state, to analyse
and decide the load and the grid bias needed for an optimal
quiescent operating point. The other loadline, which we call the
<i>dynamic loadline</i>, has to be taken into account to analyse
what happens when a signal goes through the vacuum tube and
traverse the coupling capacitors.</p>
<p>Suppose <i>R<sub>a</sub></i>=<i>R<sub>k</sub></i>=100k ohm, the
two grid leaks are <i>R<sub>l</sub></i>=180k ohm, and the high
tension is V+=380 Volts. On one hand, the total static load is 200k
ohm and produces the loadline depicted by the red line in Figure
22. On the other hand, the dynamic load seen, respectively at the
anode and at the cathode, is the result of 100k ohm in parallel
with 180k ohm, which is approximately 64k ohm. The total dynamic
load in this case is 128k ohm, which gives the green dynamic
loadline in Figure 22. Note that, since the signal oscillates
around the quiescent operating point, the dynamic loadline
intersects the static loadline exactly at this point, identified by
the red spot in the figure.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref445544282">Figure</a> 22: The concertina phase
splitter has two loadlines. The static loadline has to be
considered when the vacuum tube is in a quiescent state. In this
case, just the anode and cathode resistors contribute to the
overall load seen by the vacuum tube. When a signal is applied to
the grid, the signals at the anode and cathode of the vacuum tube
go through the coupling capacitors C<sub>cp</sub> and from these to
the grid leak resistors of the power stage, which are now parallel
to the anode and cathode resistors. The total load seen by the
vacuum tube is reduced and the dynamic loadline has to be
considered in this case.</p>
